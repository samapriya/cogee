**`cogee`** is a command-line interface (CLI) designed to simplify the process of registering Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG) assets into Google Earth Engine (GEE) image collections. It streamlines the workflow of ingesting and managing geospatial data within GEE, enabling users to efficiently access, analyze, and visualize COG assets in their GEE projects. `cogee` simplifies the workflow of registering COG assets into GEE image collections, making it easier for users to harness the power of Google Earth Engine for geospatial analysis and visualization.
